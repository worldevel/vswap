            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Have you ever seen some cartoons on TV with big eyes and very fine faces? Or maybe you know people who have rows of comics on their shelves, which for some reason read backwards? And I'm pretty sure you've shared an image of a guy wearing a sword and cat ears.</p>    
            <p>For you who may already know about Japanese culture, it may seem ridiculous that I don't clearly mention anime, manga or cosplay, but let me explain my reason behind these words.
            </p>
            <p>These are not only things, they are experiences that people like you or me have had, even without realizing them, that are part of a movement.</p>
            <p>A movement originating in Japan, which has been so popular in recent decades that it has escaped from its small origin island and spread throughout the world.
            </p>
            <p>From drawings on our televisions, black and white comics, extravagant outfits, this Japanese movement has transcended the barrier of art, and has begun to establish itself as a strong cultural current.</p>
            <p>It seems important to us to have made this clear from the beginning, since our identity revolves around what it means to belong to the culture, and to be an actor in it.
            </p>
            <p>Currently we can talk about Nft collections with anime features such as azuki, but how many of these collections really return us to this starting point where the entire community comes together?</p>
            <p>Our principles and above all, foundations, generate each of our decisions, and our principles fall on western culture, and the people around it.
            </p>
            <p>We do not offer a metaverse, a NFT game or belonging to an elite community.</p>
            <p>We offer the pleasure of reading a manga for the first time, of seeing 12 consecutive chapters of an anime in just one night, of collecting each character of your favorite saga on the shelf of your room, of being able to talk and share with people who love and share an interest as much as you.</p>
            <p>Although the metaverse is the future and every day it will become more present in our world, we believe that there are still many experiences in life. Not from the seat behind our computer, not from the Discord server in the voice chat, not from our VR in the living room, but here, in a library where we can have coffee and read for hours, in event halls with hundreds of stalls to witness, in the room of our friends watching the new chapter of one piece.</p>
